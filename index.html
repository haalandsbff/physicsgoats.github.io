            <h2 id="about">About us</h2>
            <p>We're just a traditional friendgroup of 3 residing in Oman #bestcountry. Zeena & Hajer are the physics enthusiasts & Ahmed's in his annoying brother phase. 
              We would just hit practice most of the time since some of us have nightmares about exams. School aside, we tend to
              just gossip about music, movies & series, or just shit on Manchester United. Best movie of all time is 10 things I hate about you jus sayin.</p>

            <h2 id="projects">Our work & projects</h2>
            <p>2 of us have done our extended essays on physics too so you can prolly tell we're pretty obsessed. All of our IAs scored above 19 too so yh I'd count on us for IA guidance. 
              We also have notes for almost every topic to help guide your revision & hone your exam skills. Organized revision is vital to achieving that level 7, can't operate on vibes as Zeena would say.
