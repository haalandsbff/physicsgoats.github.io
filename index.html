      <div class="abtext"><p>I'm a computer engineering student at UW Madison. A few of my hobbies are activities like football & gym,
         coding/problem solving, & learning new languages. I've been passionate about coding & football specifically since I was 10
         as both endeavors provided a number of opportunities for self improvement shaped in the form of experiences that have allowed me to 
         grow as a person who presents a brave front to adversity and acts to help the people in their community by sharing their
         expertise & with others. I'm a big advocate for skills development & I believe that given any level of creativity & abit
        of drive, you can push the limits of your imagination.</p>
        <p>I've been invested in web development for around a year & I've made numerous websites serving
         a variety of roles. Some of my projects can be found in the section below. I view web development as an implementation of computational thinking
          in an artistic context, as you
         can let your creativity take charge & direct design features & purpose of the website the same way an artist work acts as 
         a beacon of freedom & expression.</p>
       <p>I'm familiar with Java, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Python. The type of site you want isn't an obstacle, I got you covered!</p>
